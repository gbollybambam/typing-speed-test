#### Test Controls

- Start a test by clicking the start button or by clicking the passage and typing
- Select a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) for passages of varying complexity
- Switch between "Timed (60s)" mode and "Passage" mode (timer counts up, no limit)
- Restart at any time to get a new random passage from the selected difficulty

#### Typing Experience

- See real-time WPM, accuracy, and time stats while typing
- See visual feedback showing correct characters (green), errors (red/underlined), and cursor position
- Correct mistakes with backspace (original errors still count against accuracy)

#### Results & Progress

- View results showing WPM, accuracy, and characters (correct/incorrect) after completing a test
- See a "Baseline Established!" message on their first test, setting their personal best
- See a "High Score Smashed!" celebration with confetti when beating their personal best
- Have their personal best persist across sessions via localStorage

#### UI & Responsiveness

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements

### Data Model

A `data.json` file is provided with passages organized by difficulty. Each passage has the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": "easy-1",
  "text": "The sun rose over the quiet town. Birds sang in the trees as people woke up and started their day."
}
```

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Unique identifier for the passage (e.g., "easy-1", "medium-3", "hard-10") |
| `text` | string | The passage text the user will type |

### Expected Behaviors

- **Starting the test**: The timer begins when the user starts typing or clicks the start button. Clicking directly on the passage text and typing also initiates the test
- **Timed mode**: 60-second countdown. Test ends when timer reaches 0 or passage is completed
- **Passage mode**: Timer counts up with no limit. Test ends when the full passage is typed
- **Error handling**: Incorrect characters are highlighted in red with an underline. Backspace allows corrections, but errors still count against accuracy
- **Results logic**:
  - First completed test: "Baseline Established!" - sets initial personal best
  - New personal best: "High Score Smashed!" with confetti animation
  - Normal completion: "Test Complete!" with encouragement message

### Data Persistence

The personal best score should persist across browser sessions using `localStorage`. When a user beats their high score, the new value should be saved and displayed on subsequent visits.
